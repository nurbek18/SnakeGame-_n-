## Getting Started Guide

Welcome to the world of VS Code Java. Here's a simple tutorial to get you started running a Snake game in Visual Studio Code;
## Start game

As you can see in the picture above, when you run the program, the game will start automatically. You need to control the little snake through the computer cases w (front), a (left), s (back), d (right). Exercise and eat fairy beans, but don't hit the boundary, and don't press the back button in the direction the snake is walking (this will also fail).
## restart game

As you can see in the picture above, when your game fails, "You down, press Enter to restart" will be output in the interface. You only need to press the enter key to start the game.

## Technology used
This code uses the following Java technologies and features:

JavaFX Applications: Build graphical user interfaces using JavaFX.
Canvas and GraphicsContext: Classes used for drawing graphics and images in JavaFX.
AnimationTimer: used to create game loops, control game speed and animation.
KeyEvent and KeyCode: Handle user key events and corresponding key codes.
VBox: JavaFX layout class for vertically arranging child nodes.
Image: Class in JavaFX for loading and displaying images.
Random: used to generate random numbers.
Font: used to set text font style.
List and ArrayList: Java collection classes used to store snake body coordinates and handle food.
Enumeration: Defines the direction enumeration type.
Exception handling: Use try-catch blocks to catch and handle exceptions.
Static methods and properties: Use the static keyword to define static methods and properties, such as snake, direction, gameOver, etc.
